      Aside from my academic pursuits, I have a vibrant and energetic side as well. Dancing is one of my favorite hobbies. It's not just a pastime for me; it's a form of self-expression and a way to unwind. Dance allows me to tap into my creative side and connect with my emotions. Whether it's classical, contemporary, or any other form, dancing lets me escape from the rigors of my studies and experience the joy of movement and music.
